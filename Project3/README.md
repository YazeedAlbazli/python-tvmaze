# Project 3 by Yazeed Albazli

TV Shows have expanded throughout the years, and with each passing year, we get more and more shows added to the libraries. And this project aims to provide a ready-for-work dataset containing a multitude of TV show.

In this project, I have utilized an API provided by the website TV Maze. It is worth mentioning, that this website contains plenty of TV shows from many countries around the world, US, UK, Russia,...etc.

And to utilize this API, there are some required installations.

The easiest way to install the latest version
is by using pip/easy_install to pull it from PyPI:

    pip install python-tvmaze

You may also use Git to clone the repository from
Github and install it manually:

    git clone https://github.com/yakupadakli/python-tvmaze.git
    cd python-tvmaze
    python setup.py install
